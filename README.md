# 🐋 Quantum Whalesong  
### *Listening to quantum waves through the voices of the ocean.*

## Overview  
**Quantum Whalesong** transforms quantum algorithms into whale-inspired melodies and oceanic visuals.  
Each **qubit** becomes a whale.  
Each **amplitude** becomes a tone.  
Each **interference pattern** becomes a ripple across the sea.  

When you run a quantum circuit (via **Qiskit** or **Cirq**), its probability amplitudes are mapped into sound and light.  
The result is an evolving symphony — a conversation between the mathematics of the quantum world and the songs of the deep.

## How It Works  

| Layer | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Quantum Engine** | Executes algorithms such as the Quantum Fourier Transform, Bell States, or Grover’s Search using Qiskit/Cirq. Extracts amplitude and phase data from the resulting statevector. |
| **Sound Mapping** | Converts amplitudes → pitch, phases → stereo panning, magnitudes → volume. Uses Python MIDI (`music21`, `mido`, or `pyaudio`) to create sound waves. |
| **Visual Ocean** | Renders whales swimming through an ocean whose surface reacts to the quantum amplitudes. Uses `Three.js` (JavaScript) or `OpenGL` (Python/C++). |
| **Entanglement Mode** | When two qubits are entangled, their whale counterparts glow and sing in harmonic resonance — demonstrating nonlocal correlation through sound. |
